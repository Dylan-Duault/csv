#CSV

##Instalation

First run composer command

<code>composer require wilgucki/csv</code>

Next add service provider to <code>config/app.php</code> file

    'providers' => [
        //... 
        Wilgucki\Csv\CsvServiceProvider::class,
    ]

Last step is to add facades to <code>config/app.php</code> file

    'aliases' => [
        //...
        'CsvReader' => Wilgucki\Csv\Facades\Reader::class,
        'CsvWriter' => Wilgucki\Csv\Facades\Writer::class,
    ]

##Usage

###Reader

First you need to open CSV file.

    $reader = CsvReader::open('/path/to/file.csv');

If you need to change delimiter, enclosure or escape you can do it by passing proper values to <code>open</code> method.
More information about these values can be found here - [http://php.net/manual/en/function.fgetcsv.php](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fgetcsv.php).

    $reader = CsvReader::open('/path/to/file.csv', ';', '\'', '\\\\');

Having your CSV file opened you can read it line after line

    while (($line = $reader->readLine()) !== false) {
        print_r($line);
    }

or you could read whole file at once

    print_r($reader->readAll());

If your CSV file contains header line, you can convert it into array keys for each line.

    $reader = CsvReader::open($file, ';');
    $header = $reader->getHeader();
    print_r($header);
    print_r($reader->readAll());

Don't forget to close file after you're done with your work.

    $reader->close();

##Writer

At first you need to create new file
    
    $writer = CsvWriter::create('/path/where/your/file/will/be/saved.csv');

File path is optional. If you won't provide it, CsvWriter will use memory as storege for added content.

If you need to change delimiter, enclosure or escape you can do it by passing proper values to <code>create</code> method.
More information about these values can be found here - [http://php.net/manual/en/function.fputcsv.php](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fputcsv.php).

    $writer = CsvWriter::open('/path/to/file.csv', ';', '\'', '\\\\');

To add data into CSV file you can use <code>writeLine</code> or <code>writeAll</code> methods.

    $writer->writeLine(['some', 'data']);
    $writer->writeLine(['another', 'line']);
    
    $writer->writeAll([
        ['some', 'data'],
        ['another', 'line'],
    ]);

To display data added to CSV file, you can use flush method.

    echo $writer->flush();

Don't forget to close file after you're done with your work.

    $writer->close();

##TODO

- tests
- convert encoding (useful when dealing with CSV file generated by Excel)
- export Eloquent models as CSV
- import CSV to Eloquent models
